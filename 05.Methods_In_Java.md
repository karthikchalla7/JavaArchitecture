## What is a Method?

A method in Java is:
- Used to perform certain tasks
- A collection of instructions that perform a specific task
- Used to enhance code readability and reusability

## Method Declaration

Here's a basic syntax for declaring a method:

```java
public int sum(int a, int b) throws Exception {
    // method body
}
```

## Method Syntax Breakdown

### Access Specifiers
- `package`: Collection of logical/similar classes
- `public`: Accessible through any class in any package
- `private`: Accessible only by methods in the same class
- `protected`: Accessible by other classes in the same package or subclasses in different packages
- Default (no keyword): Accessible only by classes in the same package

### Return Type
- `void`: Method doesn't return anything
- Use class name or primitive data type as return type

### Method Name
- Should be a verb (action-oriented)
- Starts with a lowercase letter
- Uses camelCase for multiple words

### Parameters
- List of variables used in the method
- Parameters are declarations
- Can be empty
- When values are passed, they're called arguments

## Types of Methods

1. **System-defined methods**
   - Methods already defined and ready to use in Java (e.g., `Math.sqrt()`)

2. **User-defined methods**
   - Methods created by the programmer based on program necessity

3. **Overloaded methods** (Static Polymorphism)
   - More than one method with the same name in the same class
   - Only same method name but different arguments
   - Return type is not considered

4. **Overridden methods** (Dynamic Polymorphism)
   - Subclass has the same method as the parent class

5. **Static methods**
   - Purpose of static methods:
     - Associated with the class, not objects
     - Don't depend on objects
     - Can be called just with the class name
     - Cannot access non-static instance variables and methods
     - Cannot be overridden

## Special Method Types

### Static Methods
When to declare a method as static:
- Methods that don't modify object state
- Utility methods that only compute based on arguments
- To avoid creating multiple copies of the method for each object
- When calling from a static method, to avoid ambiguity about which object's method to use

### Final Methods
- Cannot be overridden in Java
- Why? Final method means its implementation cannot be changed
- If child class can't change implementation, there's no use of overriding

### Abstract Methods
- Defined only in abstract classes
- Only method declaration is done inside abstract class
- Implementation is done in child class

## Variable Arguments (VARARGS)
- Allows a variable number of inputs in the parameter
- Only one vararg parameter per method, must be the last argument
- Used when we don't know how many arguments are coming

Example:
```java
public static int sum(int... var) {
    // method body
}
```
