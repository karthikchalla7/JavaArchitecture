## Java 8 Features

### Default Methods

#### Background
Before Java 8, interfaces could only have abstract methods. This meant that all implementing classes had to provide implementations for every method in the interface. If a new method was added to an interface, all implementing classes had to be updated, which could be a significant maintenance burden.

#### The Problem
Consider this scenario:

```java
public interface Vehicle {
    void start();
    void stop();
}

public class Car implements Vehicle {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car starting");
    }
    
    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Car stopping");
    }
}

public class Bike implements Vehicle {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Bike starting");
    }
    
    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Bike stopping");
    }
}
```

If we wanted to add a new method `honk()` to the `Vehicle` interface, we'd have to update all implementing classes, which could be numerous and potentially in different projects or packages.

#### The Solution: Default Methods
Java 8 introduced default methods, allowing interfaces to provide a default implementation for methods. This enables adding new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.

```java
public interface Vehicle {
    void start();
    void stop();
    
    default void honk() {
        System.out.println("Beep beep!");
    }
}

// Existing implementations don't need to change
public class Car implements Vehicle {
    // ... existing methods ...
}

public class Bike implements Vehicle {
    // ... existing methods ...
    
    // Can override the default if needed
    @Override
    public void honk() {
        System.out.println("Bike horn!");
    }
}
```

#### Benefits
- Backward compatibility: New methods can be added to interfaces without breaking existing code.
- Code reuse: Common implementations can be shared across multiple classes.
- Easier API evolution: Interfaces can be extended over time without forcing all implementations to change.
- To add functionality in existing legacy system we need to use DEFAULT method. ex: stream() method in collections

### Default and Multiple inheritance:
```java

public interface Brid {
    default boolean canbreathe(){
        return  true;
    }
}

public interface livingThing {

    default boolean canbreathe(){
        return true;
    }
}


public class Eagle implements Brid,livingThing{

    //you have to override the common methods present in both the interfaces
    @Override
    public boolean canbreathe(){
        return  true;
    }
}


```

### How to extend interfaces, that contains default methods:

***1st way***

```java

public interface LivingThing {
    default boolean canBreathe(){
        return true;
    }
}


public interface Brid extends LivingThing{
}


public class Eagle implements Brid {

}

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Eagle obj = new Eagle();
        obj.canBreathe();
    }
}

```

***2nd Way***

```java
public interface LivingThing {
    default boolean canBreathe(){
        return true;
    }
}


public interface Brid extends LivingThing{
boolean canBreathe();
}


public class Eagle implements Brid {
// now here we need to override the method from Bird interface.

@Override
public boolean canBreathe(){
return true;
}

}
```
***3rd Way***

```java
public interface LivingThing {
    default boolean canBreathe(){
        return true;
    }
}


public interface Brid extends LivingThing{

//we can override parent method and as well as access the method using super
default boolean canBreathe(){
boolean canBreatheorNot = LivingThing.super.canBreathe();
return canBreatheorNot;
}
}


public class Eagle implements Brid {

}
```


### Static Methods
- we can provide the implementation of the method in interface
- but it cannot be overriden by classes which implements the interface
- we can access it using interface name itself.
- its by default public.

```java

public interface Brid {
    static boolean canbreathe(){
        return  true;
    }
}

public class Eagle implements Brid{

    //we can access static methods using class/interface name 
    public void DigestiveSystem(){
      
      if(Brid.canbreathe()){
      //do the task
      }
    }

    //If we want to override it.It will just be treatd as new method in eagle class.
    public boolean canbreathe(){
        System.out.println("Hello");
        return true;
    }

    // this gives us error because we cant override the static methods. Using @Override annotation will give error.
    @Override
    public boolean canbreathe(){
        return  true;
    }
}


```
### Private Methods and Private Static Methods
- we can provide the implementation of method but as a private access modifier in interface.
- It brings more readability of the code. For example if multiple default methods share some code,this can help.
- It can be defined as static and non-static
- From static method, we can call only private static interfac method.
- Private static method, can be called from both static and non static methods.
- Private interface method can not be abstract. Means we have to provide the implementation.
- It can be used inside of the particular interface only.

```java
public interface privateStatic {

    // this is equivalent to public abstract void canDoTheTask();
    void canDoTheTask();

    public default void minimumTask(){
        //calling static method.
        myStaticPublicMethod();
        //calling private method
        myPrivateMethod();
        //calling private static method
        myPrivateStaticMethod();
    }

    static void myStaticPublicMethod(){
        //froom static we can call other static method only
        myPrivateStaticMethod();
    }
    private void myPrivateMethod(){
        //private method implementation
    }
    private static void myPrivateStaticMethod(){
        //private static method implementation
    }
}

```
