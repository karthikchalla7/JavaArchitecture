## Singleton Class

### Objective
- The objective of this class is to create only single object.
- ex:If we want to create a DB connection, we want ti to be singleton.

### Different Ways of Creating Singleton Class
- eager initialization
- lazy initialization
- synchornization block
- double check lock(there  is a memroy issue, resolved through volatile instance variable)
- bill pugh solution
- enum singelton

### Eager Initialization:
1. created and initalized the object itself as private static so that it is associated with class and cannot be accesible outside the class.
2. created private construcor so that nobody is allowed to create the object of the class using "new" keyword.
3. created a public static method so that if other classes needed the object of this class they can access it via this method which return this same object only.
```java
package Classes_part_4;

public class DBConnection {

    private static DBConnection conObject = new DBConnection();

    private DBConnection(){

    }
    public static DBConnection getInstance(){
        return conObject;
    }

}

```
- Here we are creating and initializing as soon as program starts.

### Lazy Initialization
- it is created to solve the problem of eager initilization where we are creating and initializing the object as soon as program starts.
```java
public class LazyInitialization {
    private static LazyInitialization instance;
    
    private LazyInitialization() {
        // Private constructor
    }
    
    public static LazyInitialization getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new LazyInitialization();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```
- so in this the object will be created only when someone calls the provided method for the first time.
- after that the same object will be returned if someone needs the object and calls gets instance method.
- Its disadvantage is that if two threads tries to get the object at the same time the object is null and hence two objects will be created.

### Synchronized Method
- it is used to overcome the problem of lazy initalization where two objects might created if two threads tries to get the object for the first time.
```java
public class SynchronizedSingleton {
    private static SynchronizedSingleton instance;
    
    private SynchronizedSingleton() {
        // Private constructor
    }
    
    public static synchronized SynchronizedSingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new SynchronizedSingleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```
- so this synchronized keyword does two things
- put a lock on the method
- unlock the method.
- so only one thread is allowed to enter the method at a time. hence the possibility of 2 objects being created will be zero.
- the only disadvantage of using synchronized is that it is very very slow and generally not used.

### Double Checked Locking
- this is used majoritly over synchonized method.
- it overcomes the problems of synchonized method i.e slowness
```java
public class DoubleCheckedLockingSingleton {
    private static volatile DoubleCheckedLockingSingleton instance;
    
    private DoubleCheckedLockingSingleton() {
        // Private constructor
    }
    
    public static DoubleCheckedLockingSingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (DoubleCheckedLockingSingleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new DoubleCheckedLockingSingleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```
- so here the synchonirzed is not on method but on the block. Because of synchonized on the block the lock unlock once only.
- its disadvantage is that there is a memroy issue in this. Lets understatnd it.

- each core has it dedicated cache*L1) which is used to cache the objects and time to time it syncs with memory.
- now lets say thread T1's computation is happending at core-1 and it enters the method to get object.
- since it will get nll for the first time an object will be created and temporarily stored in cache.
- at this point thread T2 whose computation is happening at core-2 tries to get the object.
- now we do have the object created but not yet synced with the memory.
- hence a second object will be created because the object is not there in memroy.
- therefore two objects are created despite double checked locking.

**How to solve this issue:**
- this is solved using the volatile keyword.
- volatile keyword means that the object will be created in memory instead of cache.
- so if we have created any object volatile any read/write operation happening to this always happens in memory.
- since we are using memory and synchonized, this is a bit slow.

### Bill Pugh Solution
```java
public class BillPughSingleton {
    private BillPughSingleton() {
        // Private constructor
    }
    
    private static class SingletonHelper {
        private static final BillPughSingleton INSTANCE = new BillPughSingleton();
    }
    
    public static BillPughSingleton getInstance() {
        return SingletonHelper.INSTANCE;
    }
}
```
- so bill pugh solution rectified the issue of eager initialziation by putting the object inside private static nested class
- becayse this method class do not get loaded on program startup.
- Instead it is loaded when it is referred.

### Enum Singleton
```java
public enum EnumSingleton {
    INSTANCE;
    
    public void doSomething() {
        // Singleton behavior
    }
}
```
- as we know in enum all constructors are private and only one object of enum is created per JVM.
- so by default enum are singleton only.

## Immutable Classes
- we can not change the value of an object once it is created.
- declare class as final so that it can not be extended.
- all class memebers should be private. so that direct access can be avoided.
- and class members are initalized only once using constructor.
- there should not be any setter methods, which is generally use to change the value.
- just getter methods. and returns copy of the members varabiesl.
-ex: String,Wrapper classes etc
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

final class MyImmutableClass {
    private final String name;
    private final List<Object> petNameList;

    MyImmutableClass(String name, List<Object> petNameList){
        this.name = name;
        this.petNameList = petNameList;
    }

    public String getName(){
        return name;
    }

    public List<Object> getPetNameList(){
        //this is required, because making list final,
        // means you can not now point it to new list, but still can add, delete values in it
        //so thats why we send the copy of it.
        return new ArrayList<>(petNameList);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a list of pet names
        List<Object> pets = new ArrayList<>();
        pets.add("Dog");
        pets.add("Cat");
        pets.add("Fish");

        // Create an instance of MyImmutableClass
        MyImmutableClass myObj = new MyImmutableClass("John", pets);

        // Print original values
        System.out.println("Original Name: " + myObj.getName());
        System.out.println("Original Pet List: " + myObj.getPetNameList());

        // Try to modify the returned list (this won't affect the original list in myObj)
        List<Object> returnedList = myObj.getPetNameList();
        returnedList.add("Bird");

        // Print values again to show immutability
        System.out.println("\nAfter modification attempt:");
        System.out.println("Name: " + myObj.getName());
        System.out.println("Pet List: " + myObj.getPetNameList());
    }
}
```
- since we are passsing the copy of the list, new items wont be added to it hence making it truly final.
