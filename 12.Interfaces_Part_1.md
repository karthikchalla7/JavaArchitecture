## What is interface:
- Interface is something which helps 2 system to interact with each other.
- Without one system has to know the details of other
- Or in simple terms, it helps to achieve abstraction.

## How to define the interface:
- Interface declaration consists of
  - modifiers
  - interface keyword
  - comma separated list of parent interfaces
  - body
- Only public and default modifiers are allowed (protected and private are not allowed)
- Imagine system s1 and s2 where s1 is human s2 is car and I1 is interface between s1 and s2

```java
//we can create without public modifier as well.
public interface interface1 {
    public void fly();
}
```
- comma separated list of parent interfaces(only interfaces no classes)
```java
//here bird,livingthings are two seperate interfaces
public interface interface1 extends bird,livingthings {
    public void fly();
}
```
## Why we need interfaces:
### Abstraction:
   - Using interface, we can achieve full abstraction means, we can define what class must do, but not How it will do.
   - Only method definition in interface. Method implementation is done by class which implements interface.
```java
//intreface

public interface bird{
    public void fly();
    
}

//concrete class
public class eagle implements bird{
    
    public void fly(){
        //some task.
    }
}
```
### Polymorphism:
   - Interface can be used as a data type for holding the reference of the objects
   - We can not create the object of an interface but it can hold the reference of the class object which implements interface.
   - And at runtime it decides which method need to be invoked.
```java
//bird.java interface
public interface bird{
    public void fly();
    
}

//eagle.java class
public class eagle implements bird{

    @Override
    public void fly(){
        System.out.println("Eagle can fly high");
    }
}
//hen.java class
public class hen implements bird{

    @Override
    public void fly(){
        System.out.println("Hen can fly");
    }
}

//BirdMain.java
public class BirdMain {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        bird birdobj = new eagle();
        bird birdobj2 = new hen();
        birdobj2.fly();
        birdobj.fly();
    }
}
```
### Multiple inheritance:
   - In Java multiple inheritance is possible only through interface only.
   - Then solution with interface
```java
//landanimal.java interface1
package Interfaces_Part_1.MultipleInheritance;

public interface landanimal {
    public boolean canBreathe();

}

//wateranimal.java interface2
package Interfaces_Part_1.MultipleInheritance;

public interface wateranimal {
    public boolean canBreathe();
}

//crocodile.java class implement both the interfaces
package Interfaces_Part_1.MultipleInheritance;

public class crocodile implements landanimal,wateranimal{

    @Override
    public boolean canBreathe() {
        return true;
    }
}

//Main.java
package Interfaces_Part_1.MultipleInheritance;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        crocodile obj = new crocodile();
        System.out.println(obj.canBreathe());
    }
}



```

## Methods in interface:
- All methods are implicit public only.
- Method can not be declared as final.
- Final classes or methods can't be overridden
- But interface methods has to be overridden

## Fields interface:
- Fields are public, static and final implicitly (CONSTANTS)
- You can not make fields private or protected.

## Interface implementation:
- Overriding method can not have more restrict access specifiers
- Concrete class must override all the methods declared in the interfaces
- Abstract classes are not forced to override all the methods
- A class can implement from multiple interfaces.
```java
package Interfaces_Part_1;

public interface bird{
    public void fly();
    public void noOflegs();
    
}

//abstract class
package Interfaces_Part_1;

public abstract class someBirdAbstract implements bird {

    public void canfly(){
        System.out.println("This is abstrct overriding");
    }
    public abstract void beaklen();
}

//class extends abstract class
package Interfaces_Part_1;

public class whitesomeBird extends eagle{
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        super.fly();
    }

    @Override
    public void noOflegs() {

    }
}

```
## Nested interface:
- Nested interface declared within another interface
- Nested interface declared within a class
Why do we need:
- Generally its used to group, logical related interfaces. and nested interface
Rules:
- A nested interface declared within an interface must be public.
- A nested interface declared within a class can have
- When you implement outer interface inner interface implementation is not required and vice versa

```java
//bird.java interface
package Interfaces_Part_1.nestedInterface;

public interface Bird {

    public void fly();

    public interface nonflyingBird{
        public void canRun();
    }
}

package Interfaces_Part_1.nestedInterface;

public class Eagle implements Bird{

    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Eagle");
    }
}

package Interfaces_Part_1.nestedInterface;

public class Eagle1 implements Bird.nonflyingBird{

    @Override
    public void canRun() {

    }
}

package Interfaces_Part_1.nestedInterface;

public class Eagle2 implements Bird,Bird.nonflyingBird{

    @Override
    public void fly() {

    }

    @Override
    public void canRun() {

    }
}


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bird.nonflyingBird obj = new Eagle1();
        obj.canRun();
    }
}

```
