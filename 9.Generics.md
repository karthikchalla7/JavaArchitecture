## Introduction to Generics

Generics in Java provide a way to create classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on objects of various types while providing compile-time type safety. They allow you to abstract over types, making your code more flexible and reusable.

## Generic Classes

Generic classes help us write code in a generic manner, avoiding the need for typecasting that we would have to use with the Object class. 

- We need to understand why Generics are needed.
- Lets say we have a class and we know object is parent of any class.

Example:  
```java
package Classess_Generic_Part_2;

public class Generic_1 {

    Object value;

    public Object getPrintValue(){
        return value;
    }
    public void setPrintValue(Object Value){
        this.value =value;
    }
}

// In Main Method:
        Generic_1 obj1 = new Generic_1();
        obj1.setPrintValue(1);
        Object value = obj1.getPrintValue();
        //we can not use print value directly we have to typecast it, else it will be a complie time error
        if((int)value == 1){
            System.out.println(true);
        }
```

- Due to the issue of typecasting we have Generics.

Example:
```java
public class GenericBox<T> {
    private T value;

    public void setValue(T value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    public T getValue() {
        return value;
    }
}
```

In this example, `T` can be any non-primitive type (e.g., String, Integer, etc.).

## Defining Generic Classes

To define a generic class, use angle brackets `<>` after the class name, followed by a type parameter (often `T`, but it can be any valid identifier).

```java
public class GenericClass<T> {
    // class body
}
```

When creating objects, specify the actual type:

```java
GenericClass<Integer> intObj = new GenericClass<>();
GenericClass<String> strObj = new GenericClass<>();
```

## Inheritance in Generic Classes

### Non-Generic Subclass

- When extending a generic class with a non-generic subclass, you must specify the type at the time of extension:
- so here above we have extended/inherited a genric class for a non-generic subclass.
- while exteneding/inheriting a generic class for a non generic subclass we have to define the type of T at the time of Extending itself.

```java
public class NonGenericSubclass extends GenericClass<Integer> {
    // subclass implementation
}
```

### Generic Subclass

For a generic subclass, you can specify the type when creating an object:

```java
public class GenericSubclass<T> extends GenericClass<T> {
    // subclass implementation
}

GenericSubclass<Double> obj = new GenericSubclass<>();
```

## Multiple Generic Type Parameters

You can use multiple generic type parameters in a class or method:

```java
public class MultipleGenerics<T1, T2> {
    private T1 first;
    private T2 second;

    // constructor, getters, setters
}

MultipleGenerics<String, Integer> obj = new MultipleGenerics<>();
```

## Generic Methods

You can create generic methods within non-generic classes:

```java
public class Utilities {
    public <T> void printArray(T[] array) {
        for (T element : array) {
            System.out.println(element);
        }
    }
}
```

The type parameter is declared before the return type of the method.

## Raw Types

A raw type is the name of a generic class or interface without any type arguments:

```java
GenericClass rawObj = new GenericClass(); // raw type
```

Raw types are less type-safe and should be avoided in modern Java programming.

## Bounded Generics

- Bounded generics restrict the types that can be used as type arguments.
- It is used to restrict what all objects we can pass at this type parameter.
### Upper Bounded Generics
- Upper bound (<T extends Number>) means T can be of type numer or its subclass only.
- we can have interfaces as well.
- here superclass(in this example Number) we can have interface too.

```java
public class NumberBox<T extends Number> {
    // class implementation
}
```

This restricts `T` to be `Number` or its subclasses.

### Multiple Bounds
- ```<T extends Superclass & interface1 & interface2>```
- the first restrictive type should be concrete class
- 2,3 and so on can be interfaces.
```java
public class MultiBoundedClass<T extends Number & Comparable<T>> {
    // class implementation
}
```

The first bound must be a class (if present), followed by interfaces.

## Wildcards

Wildcards represent unknown types and are denoted by `?`.

### Upper Bounded Wildcard
- Upper bounded wildcard - <? extends upperboundedclassname> i.e class name and below.

```java
void processNumbers(List<? extends Number> numbers) {
    // method implementation
}
```

### Lower Bounded Wildcard
- lower bounded wildcard - <? Super LowerBoundedclassname> i.e class name and above

```java
void addIntegers(List<? super Integer> list) {
    // method implementation
}
```

### Unbounded Wildcard
- unbounded wildcard - <?> only you can read.Mostly used when my method can work on the methods provided by the object class.

```java
void printList(List<?> list) {
    // method implementation
}
```

## Generics vs. Wildcards

- Generics are used when you need to refer to a specific type throughout a class or method.
- Wildcards are used when you only need to refer to a group of related types in a single method or parameter.

- The main Differecne is that wildcards are bit less restrictive as compared to generic type.
- For example in th above we can give 2 different type of list as source and destination for the wildcard
- But for Generic method we have to give same type of list for source and destination.
- In wildcard we have boundation as well as we can use super but in generic method we cant do that.

- So since compute1 is a generic method and it will need same types as parameter.
- Therefor showing compilation error in case of different types.

## Type Erasure

- Type erasure is the process by which the Java compiler removes all type parameters and 
replaces them with their bounds or Object if the type parameters are unbounded. This is done to maintain backward compatibility with pre-generics code.
- T will replaced with whatever the type we pass.
