## 1. Introduction to Annotations

### What are Annotations?
Annotations in Java are a form of metadata that provide additional information about the code to the compiler and JVM. They don't directly affect the execution of the code but can be used to influence how the program behaves at compile-time or runtime.
- It is kind of adding META DATA to the java code
- Meta data is nothing about the class. And provides information to compiler and JVM during compile or run time.
- Means its usage its OPTIONAL
- We can use this meta data information at runtime and can add certain logic in our code if wanted.
- How to Read Meta data information? Using reflection
- Annotations can be applied at anywhere like classes,methods,interface,fields,parameters etc.

### Why use Annotations?
- To provide information to the compiler
- To enable compile-time and deployment-time processing
- To facilitate runtime processing and reflection

### Where can Annotations be used?
Annotations can be applied to various program elements:
- Classes
- Methods
- Interfaces
- Fields
- Parameters
- Constructors
- Local variables
- Packages

### How to read Annotation information?
Annotation information can be accessed at runtime using Java Reflection API.

## 2. Types of Annotations

There are two main types of annotations:

## 3. Predefined Annotations

### 3.1 @Deprecated
- usage of deprecated class or method or fields,shows you compile time WARNING.
- Deprecation means ,no further improvement is happening on this and use new alternative method or field instead.
- can be used over : Constructor,Field,Local Variable,Method,Package,Parameter,Type(class,interface,enum)

**What**: Indicates that a program element is discouraged and may be removed in future versions.

**Why**: To warn developers about outdated or potentially dangerous code.

**Where**: Can be used on classes, methods, fields, parameters, and more.

**Example**:
```java
@Deprecated
public class deprecated {

    @Deprecated
    public void dummy(){

    }
}
class Run1{
   public static void main(String[] args) {
        deprecated obj = new deprecated();
        obj.dummy();
    }
}

//we will get warning saying the below message
```

### 3.2 @Override
- During compile time, it will check that the method should be overriden.
- and throws compile time error if it do not match with the parent mehtod.
- can be use over :METHODS only.

**What**: Indicates that a method is intended to override a method in a superclass.

**Why**: To catch errors at compile-time if the method doesn't actually override a superclass method.

**Where**: Can only be used on methods.

**Example**:
```java
class Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Some sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}
```

### 3.3 @SuppressWarnings
- it will tell compiler to IGNORE any compile time WARNINGS
- use it safely, it could led to Run time excpetion, if any valid warning is IGNORED.
- we have so many supress warning names inside @SupressWarning("all") etc.
- can be used over : Field,Method,parameter,constructor,local varaible,type(clas,variable)

**What**: Tells the compiler to suppress specific warnings.

**Why**: To ignore warnings that you've determined are not relevant or important in a specific context.

**Where**: Can be used on classes, methods, fields, local variables, and more.

**Example**:
```java

public class deprecated {

    @Deprecated
    public void dummy(){

    }
}
@SuppressWarnings("all")
class Run1{
    @SuppressWarnings("deprecation")
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        deprecated obj = new deprecated();
        obj.dummy();
    }
}
```
// Java proivdes various messages inside the supresswarnings

### 3.4 @FunctionalInterface
- Restrict interface to have only one abstract method.
- throws compilation error if more than one abstract method found.
- can be used over: Type(class or interface or enum)
- Generally we use over interface.

**What**: Indicates that an interface is intended to be a functional interface (an interface with a single abstract method).

**Why**: To ensure at compile-time that the interface has only one abstract method.

**Where**: Used on interfaces.

**Example**:
```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Runnable {
    void run();
}
```

### 3.5 @SafeVarargs
- used to supress "Heap pollution warnings.
- used over methods and constructors which has varaible argumnets as parameter.
- Internally varargs stores the elements in the array.
- method should be either static or final(i.e methods can not be overriden)
- in java9 we can also use it on private methods too.

**What**: Suppresses unchecked warnings related to varargs usage.

**Why**: To indicate that the method doesn't perform potentially unsafe operations on its varargs parameter.

**Where**: Used on methods or constructors with varargs parameters.

**Example**:
```java
class run2 {
    @SafeVarargs
    public static void printLog(List<Integer>...logList){
        Object[] objectlist = logList;

        //now in the memroy the list<Integer> loglist is actually storing the list<String> due to object referecne.
        //this is called string pollution
        List<String> stringlist = new ArrayList<>();
        stringlist.add("hello");
        objectlist[0] = stringlist;
    }
}
```
//The above method shows warning of potential heap pollution.

### Heap Pollution
- Object of one type (Example String) storing the reference of another type Object(Example integer)
- explain properly how it happens and how varargs supress this.

Heap pollution is a situation in Java where a variable of a parameterized type refers to an object that is not of that parameterized type. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential runtime errors.

### Why It Occurs

Heap pollution typically occurs when mixing raw types with parameterized types or when using unchecked casts. It's particularly common when dealing with generic types and varargs (variable-length arguments).

### Example of Heap Pollution

Let's look at a concrete example to understand heap pollution better:

```java
public class HeapPollutionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> stringList = new ArrayList<String>();
        addToList(stringList, "Hello");
        addToList(stringList, 42); // This should be a compile-time error, but it's not

        String s = stringList.get(0); // OK
        String s2 = stringList.get(1); // ClassCastException at runtime
    }

    private static void addToList(List list, Object element) {
        list.add(element);
    }
}
```

In this example:
1. We create a `List<String>`.
2. We pass it to a method that takes a raw `List`.
3. The method adds both a `String` and an `Integer` to the list.
4. When we try to retrieve the second element as a `String`, we get a `ClassCastException`.

This is heap pollution because our `List<String>` now contains an `Integer`, which violates the type safety guarantee of generics.

### Varargs and Heap Pollution

Varargs methods are particularly susceptible to heap pollution. Here's why:

1. Varargs are implemented using arrays internally.
2. Arrays are covariant in Java (an array of a subtype is considered a subtype of an array of its supertype).
3. Generics are invariant (a `List<String>` is not a subtype of `List<Object>`).

This mismatch can lead to heap pollution. For example:

```java
public class VarargsHeapPollution {
    public static <T> void dangerousMethod(T... elements) {
        Object[] array = elements; // Valid, but dangerous
        array[0] = Integer.valueOf(42); // Heap pollution
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] strings = new String[2];
        dangerousMethod(strings); // Runtime ArrayStoreException
    }
}
```

In this case, the `dangerousMethod` can potentially store any type of object in the array, leading to heap pollution.

### @SafeVarargs Annotation

To address this issue, Java introduced the `@SafeVarargs` annotation. This annotation is used to suppress warnings related to potential heap pollution from varargs usage. It's a way for the developer to assert that the method's varargs usage is safe.

```java
public class SafeVarargsExample {
    @SafeVarargs
    public static <T> void safeMethod(T... elements) {
        // Method implementation that doesn't cause heap pollution
    }
}
```

When using `@SafeVarargs`:
- The method must be either `static`, `final`, or in Java 9+, `private`.
- You're asserting that the method doesn't perform unsafe operations on its varargs parameter.

//To avoid that heap pollution we use @SafeVarargs annotations over that method.
## 4. Meta-Annotations

### 4.1 @Target
- As we can see the pre defined annotations are restricted to only methods or class or type or fiedls
- this meta-annotation will restrict, where to use the annotation.
- Either at method or constructors or feilds etc..
- Syntax @Target(ElementType.METHOD)
- ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE - is used when you want to use over another annotation(META -ANNOTATION)
- Element Type: TYPE,FIELD,METHOD,PARAMETER,CONSTRUCTOR,LOCAL_VARIABLE,ANNOTATION_TYPE,PACKAGE
- TYPE_PARAMETER - allows us to apply on generic typees<T>
- TYPE_USE(java 8 feature,allow us to use annotation at all palces where type can declare like(List<@annotatin String>)

**What**: Specifies the types of program elements to which an annotation can be applied.

**Why**: To restrict where an annotation can be used.

**Where**: Used on annotation declarations.

**Example**:
```java
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
public @interface Override {
}

@Target({ElementType.CONSTRUCTOR,ElementType.METHOD})
public @interface safevarargs {
}

```

### 4.2 @Retention
- This meta-annotation tells, how annotation will be stored in java
- RetentionPolicy_SOURCE - annotations will be discarded by the compiler itself and it will not be recorded in .class file
- RetentionPolicy_CLASS - annotations will recorded in .class file but ignored but will be ignore by jvm at runtime.
- RetentionPolicy_RUNTIME - annotations will be recorded in .class file + available during run time. Usage of reflection can be done.

**What**: Specifies how long annotations should be retained.

**Why**: To control the visibility and accessibility of an annotation at different stages (source code, compiled class, runtime).

**Where**: Used on annotation declarations.

**Example**:
```java
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface RuntimeVisible {
    // ...
}
```

### 4.3 @Documented
- by default, annotations are ignored when java documentation ig generated
- with this meta-annotations even annotations will come in java docs

**What**: Indicates that annotations should be included in the generated Javadoc.

**Why**: To make annotations visible in the API documentation.

**Where**: Used on annotation declarations.

**Example**:
```java
@Documented
public @interface ApiDocumented {
    // ...
}
```

### 4.4 @Inherited
- by default ,annotations applied on parent class are not applied on child class.
- but it is after this meta-annotation.
- this meta-annotation has no effect, if annotation is used other than a class.

**What**: Indicates that an annotation on a class should be inherited by subclasses.

**Why**: To allow annotations to be passed down the class hierarchy.

**Where**: Used on annotation declarations.

**Example**:
```java
@Inherited
@Target(ElementType.TYPE)
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface MycustomAnnotation {
}

@MycustomAnnotation
class testclass{

}
class childclass extends testclass{

}
class run3{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
//        System.out.println(new testclass().getClass().getAnnotation(MycustomAnnotation.class));
        System.out.println(new childclass().getClass().getAnnotation(MycustomAnnotation.class));
    }
}

```
//In case if we remove @Inherited annotations we will get NULL.

### 4.5 @Repeatable
- allows us to use the same annotation more than one at same place.

**What**: Indicates that an annotation can be applied multiple times to the same declaration.

**Why**: To allow multiple instances of the same annotation on a single program element.

**Where**: Used on annotation declarations.

**Example**:
```java

@Repeatable(categoires.class)
@interface  category{
    String name();
}

@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface categoires {
    category[] value();
}

@category(name="bird")
@category(name="livingthing")
@category(name ="carnivorous")
class eagle{

    public void fly(){

    }
}
class main1{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        category[] catarr = new eagle().getClass().getAnnotationsByType(category.class);
        for (category annotaions:catarr){
            System.out.println(annotaions.name());
        }
    }
}```

## 5. Custom Annotations

### Creating a Custom Annotation

**Syntax**:
```java
public @interface CustomAnnotation {
    String value() default "Default value";
    int count() default 0;
}
```

**Usage**:
```java
@CustomAnnotation(value = "Custom value", count = 5)
public class AnnotatedClass {
    // ...
}
```

### Creating an Annotation with Default Values

**Example**:
```java
public @interface DefaultValueAnnotation {
    String name() default "Unknown";
    int age() default 18;
}
```

**Usage**:
```java
@DefaultValueAnnotation
public class Person {
    // Uses default values: name = "Unknown", age = 18
}

@DefaultValueAnnotation(name = "John", age = 30)
public class AnotherPerson {
    // Uses specified values
}
```

## 6. Best Practices and Use Cases

1. **Use annotations to replace XML configuration**: Many frameworks now prefer annotation-based configuration over XML.

2. **Document your custom annotations**: Provide clear documentation for any custom annotations you create.

3. **Use built-in annotations when possible**: Java and many frameworks provide a rich set of annotations. Use these before creating custom ones.

4. **Be cautious with @SuppressWarnings**: Only suppress warnings when you're certain they're not indicating a real problem.

5. **Leverage annotations for code analysis**: Tools like FindBugs and PMD can use annotations to improve code quality.

6. **Use annotations for dependency injection**: Frameworks like Spring heavily use annotations for dependency injection and configuration.

7. **Implement custom processing**: Create annotation processors to generate code or perform checks at compile-time.

8. **Use annotations for testing**: Frameworks like JUnit use annotations to identify and configure tests.

9. **Apply annotations for persistence**: JPA uses annotations to map Java objects to database tables.

10. **Utilize annotations for validation**: Bean Validation API uses annotations to define constraints on fields and methods.
