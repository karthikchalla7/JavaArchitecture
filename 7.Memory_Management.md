## MemoryManagement

## Two types of Memory(RAM)
1. Stack
2. Heap

* Both Stack and Heap are created by JVM and stored in RAM

## Stack Memory
- Stores temporary variables and sepreate memory blocks for methods
- Stores primitive data types
- Stores reference variables of the heap objects
  1. strong reference
     - ex: Object obj = new Object(); strong reference
     - Till the time the refercne exists GC wont be able to delete the object from the heap memory.
  2. weak reference
     - As soon as GC runs it will remove the obj
     - ex: WeakRef<Person> weakobj = new WeakRef<Person>(new Person);
  3. soft reference
     - It allows to remove the object by the GC if the space is not present.
     - Totally this depends on the space in heap.
- Ex: Object reference = new Object(); reference - stored in stack
- Each thread has its own stack memory (Due to this we can have multiple stacks) but they share only one heap memory
- Variables/Methods within a SCOPE is only visible and as soon as variable/method goes out of scope it gets deleted from the stack(in LIFO order)
- All the objects created in heap will be removed by Garbage Collector after reference varaibles are deleted from the stack.
- JVM runs GC periodically and take cares of the dead objects.
- When stack memory goes full, it throws "java.lang.StackOverflowError"
- String pools are stored in heap so any stringliterals are stored in heap whereas as the reference varaibles are stored in stack.
- But when you create string using new keyword then it creates a new memmory for storing in heap.
- Reference can be changed by referencing a current object to a new variable.
  - ex: person obj1 = new person() //created new object
  - person obj2 = new person() //created another object
  - obj1 = obj2;
  - Now obj1 will have a reference for the object for obj2 in heap and when GC runs, the earlier object which obj1 was refering to will be deletd.


## Heap Memory
- Stores objects
- There is no order for allocating the memory
- Garbage collector is used to delete the unreferenced objects from the heap.
- Garbage collector ran by JVM to remove the obejct which doesn't have any object references. JVM will have total control over freeing up the heap memory.
 - Mark and Sweep Algorithm
   - Marks the objects which doesn't have any references it marks since their is no reference
   - Then sweep comes and removes the marked objects and moves the remaining to survior space(s0,s1) along with age.
   - This way we can keep eden and the subsequent surivor space for objects to come.
   - We can give threshold for the objects based on age let say if age is 3 then move those objects to old generation.
 - Types of GC:
   - Serial GC
     - Only one thread is working.
     - Disadavantages are very slow and GC is very expensive
     - Whenever GC starts all the application threads will get paused
     - The world stops when GC runs.
     - To tackle this we have parallel GC
   - parallel GC
     - Default in java 8
     - Multiple threads are working parllely
   - CMS(concurrent mark sweep)
     - Further improve parallel gc there comes CMS
     - Application threads will not stop but it is not for sure
     - no memory compaction happens but pausing still remains.
   - G1
     - The better version of CMS
     - This brings the compaction all the freed up memory is brought to back. With less pause time
- Heap memory is shared with all the threads
- Heap also contains string pool
- When heap memory goes full,it throws "java.lang.OutofMemoryError"
- Heap memory is further divided into:

  - Young Generation(minor GC happens here)
    - Eden
    - Survivor Space(S0,S1)
  - Old/Tenured Generation(major GC happens here)
  - Permanent Generation changed to (non heap - meta space)

## Example of Young and Old Generation.
- Now lets see when we create an object what happens to it.
- Whenever a new object is created it goes to EDEN first. Lets say we have created 5 objects (o1 to 05).
- They will be created in EDEN first.So now heap memory looks like
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31e5f7e1-6949-4881-9ebe-58766efd5c8b)

- So 5 objects are creatd inside eden.
- Now lets say Garbage Collector  run and there is no reference for o2,o5 objects in the heap space. So now GC will use mark and sweep algorith i.e.
- In Mark GC will marks the objects which no more have reference and then sweep in which it will do two 2 things:
  - First remove de-referenced objects(o2 and o5) from the memory
  - Move the rest to surviour objects into one of the surviour space i.e s0 or s2 and adds age to the objects. So after GC runs heap now looks like
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68393d49-b2d6-4ca8-9a33-de1fa690c71a)

- Now GC has ran once. This whole process is called minor GC as it happends very periodically and very fast.
- Lets now create 2 more objects (o6,o7). So heap now looks like
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16523c3f-fd80-40df-9fc8-b44c424bd31a)

- O6 and O7 objects are now created in eden. Now lets say the GC ran again and this time no reference is there for O4,7 objects.So now GC will now:
  - Mark O4,7
  - Deletes O4,7
  - Moves o1,o6,o3(surviours) for S1 with corresponding ages.
- Therefore post this minor GC, the heap looks like:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b312c847-4f0b-4120-b9b4-eba80a055b40)

- So at one time eden would be completely free after the GC and one of the survivor space (s0 or s1) would be free and we put data alternatively in s0 and s1 along with the respective age.
- Now lets create two more objects o8m9 and heap looks like:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebe3f655-ee3f-4596-b163-abb8797bc7d4)

- Now lets say i have se the threshold age to 3.
- Therefore now objects with age 3 needs to be promoted.
- Promotion means that now the objects with age 3 will be moved to old generation.
- Lets now run GC assuming that there are no more references for 03and4 objects hence will be deletd.So GC will now
  - Mark o3,8
  - Delete o3,8
  - Move the survivor objects(o6,9) for s0 and since o1 still have reference with age 3, it will be promoted i.e moved to old generation.
- Now the heap looks like:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21680dff-074c-4815-9cdc-22c5c2804306)

- In the old generation only difference is that here it is called major GC because GC in old generation wont run too periodically.So in old generation the GC runs less periodically as compared for young gen and the objects in old gen are kind of big objects that are used too frequently and these might have alot of references pointing to them.

- Now lets come to meta space. what will it store?
- The metaspace contains:
  - class variables.
  - class metadata(basically stores info about class from which objects can be created)
  - Constants

## Garbage Collector Algo
- Mark and Sweep and Compact memory

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4454563c-daf4-482d-9437-5cdcef501f0b)

- Similar to mark and sweep but difference comes with compact
- So after removing their will be spaces in between so this compact will align the remaining object in order and makes spaces in the end.
- The world stops when the Garbage Collector runs
