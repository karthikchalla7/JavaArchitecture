## Reference Types

Reference types in Java include:
1. Classes
2. Strings
3. Interfaces
4. Arrays

Key points:
- Reference types store addresses pointing to objects in memory.
- They use pass-by-reference when passed as method arguments.
- Created using the `new` keyword (except for some String cases).

Example:
```java
Object obj = new Object();
```

## String in Java

Strings are immutable reference types with special properties:

- Stored in the String Constant Pool within the heap memory.
- String literals are created without the `new` keyword.
- Multiple references can point to the same String object in the pool.

Example:
```java
String s1 = "hello";
String s2 = "hello";
String s3 = new String("hello");

System.out.println(s1 == s2);      // true (same object in pool)
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true (same content)
System.out.println(s1 == s3);      // false (different objects)
System.out.println(s1.equals(s3)); // true (same content)
```

Note: Avoid using Strings for storing sensitive information like passwords due to the String pool.

## Interfaces

- Reference type similar to classes.
- Cannot be instantiated directly.
- Classes implementing an interface must override its methods.

Example:
```java
interface Person {
    void work();
}

class Teacher implements Person {
    public void work() {
        System.out.println("Teaching");
    }
}

Person teacher = new Teacher();
```

## Arrays

- Sequence of memory storing elements of the same datatype.
- Reference type in Java.

Syntax:
```java
int[] arr = new int[5];
```

## Wrapper Classes

Wrapper classes provide object representations of primitive types:
```

| Primitive Type | Wrapper Class |
|----------------|---------------|
| int            | Integer       |
| char           | Character     |
| byte           | Byte          |
| short          | Short         |
| long           | Long          |
| float          | Float         |
| double         | Double        |
| boolean        | Boolean       |
```

Key benefits:
1. Allow primitive types to be used where objects are required (e.g., in collections).
2. Provide utility methods for type conversion and manipulation.

## Autoboxing and Unboxing

Autoboxing: Automatic conversion of primitive types to their wrapper classes.
Unboxing: Automatic conversion of wrapper classes to their primitive types.

Example:
```java
// Autoboxing
int a = 20;
Integer a1 = a;

// Unboxing
Integer x = 10;
int val = x;  // No explicit casting needed
```

## Constant Variables

- Declared using `static final` keywords.
- Convention: Use all uppercase letters with underscores for naming.
- Cannot be changed after initialization.

Example:
```java
static final int MAX_USERS = 100;
```

## Interview Focus Points with Answers

1. Reference vs Primitive Types
   - Primitive types store actual values (int, char, etc.), reference types store addresses of objects.
   - Primitives are stored on the stack, objects are stored on the heap.
   - Java uses pass-by-value for both, but for references, the value passed is the memory address.

2. String Handling
   - Strings are immutable for security, caching, and synchronization benefits.
   - String pool optimizes memory by reusing string literals.
   - `String s1 = "hello"` may reuse an existing string from the pool, `new String("hello")` always creates a new object.
   - Strings in the pool can be viewed by anyone with access to the runtime, making them unsuitable for sensitive data.

3. Wrapper Classes
   - Each primitive has a wrapper: Integer, Character, Byte, Short, Long, Float, Double, Boolean.
   - Used in collections, allow null values, and provide utility methods.

4. Autoboxing and Unboxing
   - Autoboxing: Automatic conversion of primitives to wrapper objects.
   - Unboxing: Automatic conversion of wrapper objects to primitives.
   - Example: `Integer i = 10;` (autoboxing), `int j = i;` (unboxing)
   - Can impact performance if overused, especially in loops.

5. Interfaces
   - Define a contract for classes to implement.
   - Unlike abstract classes, interfaces support multiple inheritance.
   - Prefer interfaces for defining types and when multiple inheritance is needed.

6. Arrays
   - Arrays are objects, thus reference types.
   - Declaration: `int[] arr;` Initialization: `arr = new int[5];`
   - Multi-dimensional arrays are arrays of arrays: `int[][] matrix = new int[3][3];`

7. Constant Variables
   - Declared as `static final`.
   - Named in ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES.
   - Used for values that shouldn't change, like mathematical constants or configuration values.

8. Memory Management
   - Objects (reference types) are allocated on the heap.
   - Garbage collector automatically frees memory of unreferenced objects.

9. Equality Comparisons
   - `==` compares object references (memory addresses).
   - `.equals()` compares object contents (if properly implemented).
   - Use `==` for primitives, `.equals()` for objects (especially Strings).

10. Collections and Generics
    - Collections store objects, not primitives, hence the need for wrapper classes.
    - Generics provide type safety and eliminate the need for casting.

11. Method Overriding and Polymorphism
    - Reference types allow runtime polymorphism through method overriding.
    - Interfaces enable multiple inheritance of behavior.

12. Best Practices
    - Use primitives for simple values, wrappers when objects are required.
    - Use StringBuilder for extensive string modifications to improve performance.
