## What is an Exception?
An exception is:
- An event that occurs during program execution
- Disrupts the normal flow of the program
- Creates an exception object containing:
  - Type of exception and message
  - Stack trace
- The runtime system uses this object to find the appropriate handler

```java
public class exception1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        exception1 obj = new exception1();
        obj.method1();
    }


    public void method1(){
        method2();
    }
    public void method2(){
        method3();
    }
    public void method3(){
        int b = 5/0;
    }
}

```
- After running the above code we get the following error.
-This is known as stack trace error.

## Error vs Exception
- Errors: Uncontrollable, often related to JVM issues
- Exceptions: Can be properly handled
- Errors occur at runtime, often due to memory issues

## Types of Exceptions

### Unchecked/Runtime Exceptions
Occur during runtime; compiler doesn't force handling

1. ClassCastException
```java
public class ClassCastExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object obj = "Hello";
        try {
            Integer number = (Integer) obj;
            System.out.println("Number: " + number);
        } catch (ClassCastException e) {
            System.out.println("ClassCastException caught: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```
- This code demonstrates a ClassCastException
- It happens when trying to cast an object to an incompatible type
- We have a String object but try to cast it to an Integer
- Since String can't be converted to Integer, Java throws a ClassCastException

2. ArithmeticException
```java
public class ArithmeticExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int numerator = 10;
        int denominator = 0;
        try {
            int result = numerator / denominator;
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("ArithmeticException caught: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```
- This example demonstrates an ArithmeticException
- It occurs when trying to divide by zero
- The program attempts to divide 10 by 0, which is mathematically undefined
- Java throws an ArithmeticException to prevent this invalid operation

3. IndexOutOfBoundsException
- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
```java
public class ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
        try {
            int value = numbers[3];
            System.out.println("Value: " + value);
        } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            System.out.println("ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException caught: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```
- This example illustrates an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
- It occurs when trying to access an array index that doesn't exist
- The array has indices 0, 1, and 2, but we try to access index 3
- Java throws this exception to prevent accessing memory outside the array

- StringIndexOutOfBoundsException

```java
public class StringIndexOutOfBoundsExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "Hello";
        try {
            char character = text.charAt(10);
            System.out.println("Character at index 10: " + character);
        } catch (StringIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            System.out.println("StringIndexOutOfBoundsException caught: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

- This example demonstrates a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
- It occurs when trying to access a character at an invalid index in a String
- The string "Hello" has indices 0 to 4 (5 characters)
- We try to access the character at index 10, which doesn't exist
- Java throws a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException to prevent accessing memory outside the string's bounds

4. NullPointerException
```java
public class NullPointerExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = null;
        try {
            int length = str.length();
            System.out.println("String length: " + length);
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            System.out.println("NullPointerException caught: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```
- This code shows a NullPointerException
- It happens when trying to use a method or access a property on a null object
- Here, we try to get the length of a null string
- Since null doesn't have any methods, Java throws a NullPointerException

5. IllegalArgumentException (including NumberFormatException)

```java
public class IllegalArgumentExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            validateAge(-5);
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            System.out.println("IllegalArgumentException caught: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    public static void validateAge(int age) {
        if (age < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age cannot be negative");
        }
        System.out.println("Age is valid: " + age);
    }
}
```
- This example shows an IllegalArgumentException
- It's typically thrown manually to indicate that a method has received an inappropriate argument
- Here, we check if the age is negative, which is illogical
- If it is, we throw an IllegalArgumentException with a custom message

### Checked/Compile-Time Exceptions
- Verified by compiler; must be caught or declared to be thrown
- Handling required: try-catch block or throws declaration

## Handling Exceptions

### Using `throws`
- Indicates a method might throw an exception
- Delegates error handling to the caller method

### Try-Catch Block
- Handles errors within the method
- Allows for exception logging
- Can still delegate to caller if needed
- Catch block can only catch exception whihc is thrown by try block.
## Exception Handling Keywords

### try/catch
- `try`: Specifies code that may throw an exception
- `catch`: Catches and handles exceptions from the try block
- Multiple catch blocks allowed
- Order matters: more specific exceptions before general ones

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/588c8861-917b-437e-a86f-ce06ee392c75)

- so here since exception is parent so while catching make sure it at the last in the catch blocks.
- Usually this needs to be taken care of while using multiple catch blocks.
- We can also catch multiple exceptions in one catch blocl
```java
catch(ClassNotFoundException | InterupptedException exp){
}
```

### finally
- Always executes, regardless of exception occurrence
- Used for cleanup operations (e.g., closing resources)
- Only one finally block allowed per try
- Mostly used for closing the obejct,adding logs etc.
- Finally block can be use after try or after catch block.
- May not execute in cases of JVM issues or forced process termination

### Example using Try-Catch-Finally:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0419ea5-4925-4a1d-8157-ddf9d782885d)

- So in this the checked exception is caught by the catch block and finally is executed.
- Now lets use only try/finally in case of checked exception we need to be carefully since in this case we dont have catch block
- So in this case we delegate the error using throws on method level.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2142a794-4859-41b5-90d6-b550337b1995)

-In case if we are using try-finally thne if its runtime/unchecked exception then we dont have to worry.

### throw
- Used to throw a new exception
- Can re-throw an exception

### throws
- Declares that a method might throw specific exceptions

## Creating Custom Exceptions

1. First, let's create a custom exception:

```java
public class InvalidAgeException extends Exception {
    public InvalidAgeException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

This is the basic syntax for creating a user-defined exception:
- Create a class that extends `Exception` (for checked exceptions) or `RuntimeException` (for unchecked exceptions).
- Typically, you'll want to provide a constructor that takes a String message and passes it to the superclass constructor.

2. Now, let's create a simple program that uses this custom exception:

```java
public class CustomExceptionExample {
    public static void validateAge(int age) throws InvalidAgeException {
        if (age < 0) {
            throw new InvalidAgeException("Age cannot be negative");
        } else if (age > 120) {
            throw new InvalidAgeException("Age cannot be greater than 120");
        }
        System.out.println("Age is valid: " + age);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            validateAge(-5);
        } catch (InvalidAgeException e) {
            System.out.println("Invalid Age Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }

        try {
            validateAge(150);
        } catch (InvalidAgeException e) {
            System.out.println("Invalid Age Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }

        try {
            validateAge(25);
        } catch (InvalidAgeException e) {
            System.out.println("Invalid Age Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

Let's break down this example:

1. We define a method `validateAge` that checks if an age is valid.
2. If the age is invalid, we throw our custom `InvalidAgeException` with an appropriate message.
3. The `validateAge` method declares that it can throw `InvalidAgeException` using the `throws` keyword.
4. In the `main` method, we call `validateAge` with different values.
5. We surround each call with a try-catch block to handle the potential `InvalidAgeException`.

When you run this program, it will output:

```
Invalid Age Error: Age cannot be negative
Invalid Age Error: Age cannot be greater than 120
Age is valid: 25
```

This example demonstrates how to:
- Create a custom exception
- Throw the custom exception when specific conditions are met
- Declare that a method can throw the custom exception
- Catch and handle the custom exception

## Advantages of Exception Handling
- Separates error handling from regular code
- Allows program recovery from errors
- Supports debugging with additional information
- Improves security by hiding sensitive information

## Disadvantages of Exception Handling
- Can be expensive if the stack trace is large
- Performance impact if not handled properly or handled at a high level in the class hierarchy
